# vinivosh's bash scripts

Repository for various scripts I use in my Linux machine(s). Made this **public** because it might be helpful for someone else, I guess!

## My current setup

Currently using CachyOS (Arch-based, btw ☝️🤓) with KDE Plasma 6. Some of these will not be useful if you're using some other desktop environment or distro. I'll try my best to make this clear in a per script basis.

## Dependencies

Various scripts here need these installed

- [Wine](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wine#Installation)
- [Steam](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Steam#Installation)
- [Gamescope](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Gamescope#Installation)
